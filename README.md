# Classification of iris flowers species

Simple trained model classification of different iris flowers species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Prediction model created with the scikit-learn ml library and the k nearest neighbors algorithm. The dataset is composed of 3 different species split 50/50/50. Training and testing set was split 0.7/0.3.

These specific parameters achieve a prediction accuracy rate of 97.78%.
